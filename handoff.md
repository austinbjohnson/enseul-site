# Handoff Reference

This repo follows the shared workflow documented at the websites root.

- Master session notes: `../handoff/SESSION_NOTES.md`
- Co-dev reminders: `../REMINDER.md`

## Site-Specific Notes

- [ ] Review PR `Add tranquil gradient placeholder landing` after running local checks, then merge when satisfied.
- [ ] Track branch `feature/gradient-placeholder`; keep gradient hero as-is during copy pass.
- [x] Append a dictionary-style entry beneath the logotype: phonetic pronunciation (English), definition (“alone together”), and etymology (ensemble + seulement). (See `index.html` responsive block.)
- [ ] Audit spacing/typography on mobile once the new copy lands; responsive font/spacing clamps added in `index.html`, still needs real device confirmation.
